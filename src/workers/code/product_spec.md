**4. Technical Specifications**

*   **4.1. Frontend Requirements:**
    *   **User Interface (UI) & User Experience (UX):**
        *   Clean, minimalist design focusing on product presentation.
        *   Intuitive navigation structure.
        *   Consistent visual style across all pages.
        *   High-quality product image display with zoom/gallery features.
        *   Clear calls to action (e.g., "Add to Cart," "Checkout").
    *   **Specific Page/Component Requirements:**
        *   Homepage: Dynamic content (featured items, categories), search bar, clear calls to action.
        *   Product Listing Page: Responsive grid/list view, sticky filters/sorting on scroll (optional), clear product cards with image, name, price, and seller info.
        *   Product Detail Page: Responsive image carousel/gallery, distinct sections for description, reviews, seller info; clear display of price and variations.
        *   Shopping Cart: Summary view, easy quantity updates, clear subtotal and path to checkout.
        *   Checkout: Secure, multi-step process with progress indicator; clear forms with validation; summary of items and costs before final confirmation.
        *   User Dashboards: Clean layout with easy access to relevant sections (orders, profile, products, sales).
    *   **Technology Stack Considerations:**
        *   Modern JavaScript Framework (e.g., React, Vue.js, Angular) for a dynamic Single Page Application (SPA) experience or Next.js/Nuxt.js for server-side rendering (SSR) benefits (SEO, performance).
        *   HTML5, CSS3 (potentially with a preprocessor like SASS or styling library like Styled Components/Tailwind CSS).
        *   RESTful API communication for data fetching and submission.
    *   **Performance:** Optimized asset loading (images, scripts), code splitting, lazy loading of components/images below the fold.
    *   **Security:** Secure handling of sensitive data input (HTTPS is mandatory), client-side input validation (in addition to server-side), protecting against common frontend vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS).
    *   **Accessibility:** Adherence to WCAG 2.1 Level AA guidelines (semantic HTML, ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, color contrast).

*   **4.2. Backend Requirements:**
    *   **Architecture:** Microservices or well-structured Monolith, depending on team size and scaling strategy. RESTful API endpoints for frontend communication.
    *   **Core Modules:**
        *   **Authentication & Authorization Service:** Handles user registration, login, password reset, session/token management (e.g., JWT), role-based access control.
        *   **User Service:** Manages user profiles (customer and seller specific attributes).
        *   **Product Service:** Handles CRUD for products, categories, attributes, inventory updates. Integrates with file storage for images.
        *   **Order Service:** Creates, retrieves, and updates order information. Manages order statuses, links products, customers, and sellers.
        *   **Payment Service:** Integrates with external payment gateway API (e.g., Stripe, PayPal). Handles transaction initiation, callback processing, and basic refunds. *Does not store sensitive payment information directly.*
        *   **Search Service:** Implements search functionality, potentially using a dedicated search engine (e.g., Elasticsearch) or database indexing for full-text search.
        *   **Notification Service:** Sends email notifications for triggered events (new order, order shipped, etc.).
        *   **Review Service:** Handles submission, storage, and retrieval of product reviews and ratings. Includes moderation capabilities.
        *   **Admin Service:** Provides API endpoints for admin panel functionalities (user/product/order management).
    *   **Database:**
        *   Relational Database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) to store structured data like users, products, orders, categories, reviews.
        *   Schema design to reflect relationships: `users` (with role/type), `sellers` (linked to users), `products` (linked to sellers), `categories`, `orders` (linked to customers), `order_items` (linked to orders and products), `reviews` (linked to products and customers).
        *   Proper indexing for performance, especially on frequently queried fields (e.g., product name, category, user ID, order ID).
    *   **API Design:**
        *   Follow RESTful principles.
        *   Use standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
        *   JSON for request and response bodies.
        *   Clear, consistent endpoint naming conventions.
        *   API versioning (e.g., `/api/v1/products`).
        *   Authentication and authorization applied to relevant endpoints.
    *   **Technology Stack Considerations:**
        *   Backend Language/Framework: Node.js (Express, NestJS), Python (Django, Flask), Ruby on Rails, PHP (Laravel), Java (Spring Boot), Go - choice based on team expertise, performance needs, and ecosystem.
        *   Database: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB.
        *   Image Storage: Cloud storage service (AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage).
        *   Payment Gateway Integration: Select a reputable provider (Stripe, PayPal, Square, etc.).
        *   Search: Database full-text search or dedicated solution (Elasticsearch, Algolia).
    *   **Scalability:** Stateless application servers, database horizontal scaling strategy (read replicas, sharding), caching layer (Redis, Memcached).
    *   **Security:** OWASP Top 10 mitigation (SQL injection, XSS, CSRF prevention), secure password hashing (Bcrypt), input validation and sanitization, API authentication (e.g., JWT), role-based authorization checks on all relevant endpoints, secure configuration, regular security patching.
    *   **Reliability:** Graceful error handling, comprehensive logging, monitoring of system health and performance.
    *   **Performance:** Optimized database queries, caching of frequently accessed data, efficient background job processing (e.g., sending emails).

*   **4.3. Infrastructure & Deployment Considerations:**
    *   Cloud Provider: AWS, Google Cloud Platform, Azure (for compute, database, storage).
    *   Containerization: Docker for consistent environments.
    *   Orchestration (Optional for V1, beneficial for scaling): Kubernetes, Docker Swarm.
    *   Database Hosting: Managed database service from the cloud provider.
    *   File Storage: Managed object storage service (S3, GCS).
    *   Content Delivery Network (CDN): Cloudflare, AWS CloudFront for caching static assets and improving global performance.
    *   Monitoring & Logging: Centralized logging (ELK stack, Datadog), application performance monitoring (APM - New Relic, Datadog, Sentry), infrastructure monitoring (CloudWatch, Prometheus).
    *   CI/CD Pipeline: Automated build, test, and deployment using tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions, CircleCI.
