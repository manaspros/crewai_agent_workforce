E-commerce Website for Handmade Crafts - Security Assessment Report

Introduction

This report presents a security assessment of the provided documentation and code artifacts for the E-commerce Website for Handmade Crafts, focusing on identifying potential vulnerabilities and evaluating adherence to security best practices. The review encompassed product specifications, frontend development plans and sample code, backend implementation plans and sample code (specifically Engineer 3's assignments), and a test plan. All code artifacts were reviewed as if sourced from a designated 'code' folder, a standard practice for organizing project source code for deployment and management. No markdown formatting is used in this report.

Scope of Assessment

The assessment covered the security aspects derived from the provided documents and code snippets, focusing on the backend implementation plan and the sample Flask code for Engineer 3's assignments, as these represent the core logic handling sensitive data and user interactions. Frontend HTML structure and basic JavaScript were reviewed for immediate client-side risks, and documentation was reviewed for stated security requirements and considerations.

Findings and Vulnerabilities

Based on the review, the following potential security vulnerabilities and areas of concern were identified:

1.  Hardcoded Sensitive Information (Critical):
    The backend Python code (`engineer3_backend_code.py`) includes a hardcoded JWT secret key (`app.config["JWT_SECRET_KEY"] = "super-secret-engineer3-key"` and the comment mentioning `"super-secret-engineer1-base-key-replace-me"`). Hardcoding secret keys in source code is a critical vulnerability as it can easily be exposed, compromising the security of JWT tokens and potentially allowing unauthorized access.

2.  Skipped Webhook Signature Verification (Critical in Production):
    The `payment_webhook` endpoint explicitly skips signature verification (`# try... except ... # For this simulation, we'll skip signature verification`). In a real production environment, receiving and processing data from a payment gateway webhook without verifying the signature is a critical security flaw. It allows attackers to send forged requests, potentially manipulating order statuses or triggering fraudulent actions. While skipped for simulation, this is a major risk in a live system based on this pattern.

3.  Insufficient Input Validation and Sanitization (High):
    While some basic validation (e.g., quantity checks, required fields) is present, the provided code does not demonstrate comprehensive input validation and sanitization for all user-provided data. For example, text fields like shipping addresses, review comments, product titles/descriptions (expected from other engineers but interacting with data structures used by Engineer 3), and tracking numbers appear to lack thorough checks for unexpected data types, lengths, or malicious content. This can lead to various vulnerabilities depending on downstream processing, including potential injection attacks (if used in dynamic queries, though less relevant for the in-memory dict sim) or Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if displayed directly on the frontend without proper encoding (a frontend concern, but backend validation helps mitigate).

4.  Lack of Real Database Transactions (High):
    The backend code uses in-memory Python dictionaries to simulate a database. While `try...except` blocks simulate rollback logic, this does not provide actual transactional safety. In a real database system (like SQL as suggested in the plan), operations involving multiple steps (e.g., decreasing inventory and creating an order) must be wrapped in transactions to ensure atomicity. Without this, partial updates can occur if an error happens midway (e.g., inventory decreased, but order not saved), leading to data inconsistency and potential business logic flaws that can be exploited (e.g., overselling).

5.  Inadequate Secure File Storage Implementation (High, based on plan):
    The documentation mentions storing product images (e.g., on S3). While Engineer 3's code only references image URLs, the security of file uploads, storage, and serving is crucial. This involves validating file types/sizes, storing files outside the webroot, using secure naming conventions, and implementing access controls to prevent unauthorized access or execution of uploaded files. This area is a common source of vulnerabilities and is not addressed in the provided code snippet.

6.  Lack of Rate Limiting (High):
    The backend endpoints, particularly potentially resource-intensive ones or those involved in sensitive actions (like adding to cart repeatedly, initiating payments, or login attempts - though login is handled by Engineer 1), do not appear to have rate limiting implemented. This leaves the application vulnerable to brute-force attacks, denial-of-service attacks, and resource exhaustion.

7.  Limited Logging and Monitoring (Medium):
    The code includes print statements for simulation purposes, but there is no indication of a robust logging and monitoring strategy. Proper logging of security events (e.g., failed login attempts, authorization failures, validation errors, suspicious activity) and system errors is essential for detection, investigation, and response to security incidents.

8.  Sensitive Data Handling in Simulation (Medium):
    While using in-memory dicts is for simulation, a real database would handle sensitive data like shipping addresses, potentially payment-related tokens (though PCI compliance dictates sensitive card data is not stored directly), and user information. Encryption at rest for such data in the actual database implementation is a necessary security measure not demonstrated or explicitly detailed beyond general data protection mentions.

Recommendations for Remediation

The following recommendations are made to address the identified vulnerabilities and improve the security posture:

1.  Secure Configuration Management:
    Move all sensitive configuration values, such as the JWT secret key and payment gateway API keys/secrets, out of the source code. Use environment variables, a secure configuration file parser, or a dedicated secret management system.

2.  Implement Webhook Signature Verification:
    Crucially implement the payment gateway's recommended signature verification process for the webhook endpoint (`/api/checkout/payment-webhook`). Reject requests with invalid signatures immediately.

3.  Enhance Input Validation and Sanitization:
    Implement robust server-side validation for all API inputs. This includes:
    -   Type checking and casting.
    -   Length limits for strings.
    -   Range checks for numbers (e.g., non-negative quantities, rating 1-5).
    -   Regular expressions for format validation (e.g., email, tracking number format if applicable).
    -   Sanitization of string inputs before processing or storing, especially for fields that will be displayed on the frontend (e.g., comments, descriptions) to prevent XSS. Use appropriate encoding/escaping when displaying user-provided data.

4.  Adopt a Relational Database with Transaction Support:
    Implement the backend using a real relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) via an ORM (e.g., SQLAlchemy, Django ORM). Ensure that critical operations involving multiple data modifications (like order creation, which updates inventory and creates order/order items) are wrapped in database transactions to guarantee atomicity and data consistency.

5.  Implement Secure File Storage:
    For product images and other uploads, implement a secure file storage solution. Store files outside the webroot, use unique and unpredictable filenames, validate file types and scan for malicious content upon upload, and configure storage access controls to prevent unauthorized access.

6.  Implement Rate Limiting:
    Apply rate limiting to relevant API endpoints (e.g., login, registration, password reset requests, potentially cart and checkout endpoints) to mitigate brute-force and DoS attacks.

7.  Implement Comprehensive Logging and Monitoring:
    Integrate a robust logging system to record security-relevant events, errors, and application activity. Implement monitoring and alerting to detect suspicious patterns or failures in real-time.

8.  Secure Sensitive Data at Rest:
    In the actual database implementation, ensure that sensitive data, particularly user information and shipping addresses, is encrypted at rest. Adhere strictly to PCI compliance standards for handling any payment-related data.

9.  Review and Refine Authorization Checks:
    Continuously review and test the access control decorators (`@customer_required`, `@seller_required`, `@admin_required`) and the logic within endpoints that access or modify resources to ensure that users can only access or modify data they are authorized to (e.g., customers accessing only their own orders, sellers managing only their own products and relevant order items). The current code correctly implements ownership checks for sensitive operations, but thorough testing is required.

10. Keep Dependencies Updated:
    Regularly update Flask, Flask-JWT-Extended, and any other libraries used to patch security vulnerabilities.

Conclusion

The provided code artifacts demonstrate a clear plan and initial implementation of core e-commerce functionalities. However, as a security auditor, several critical and high-priority vulnerabilities are present in the simulated backend code, primarily related to the handling of secrets, external integrations (webhooks), input validation, and the lack of real database transactional integrity and secure data storage methods inherent in the simulation approach. Implementing the recommended remediations, particularly moving to a proper database with transactions, securing configuration, validating all inputs rigorously, and correctly implementing external service integrations (like webhooks), is essential before moving towards production deployment.
